In any robotics or industrial application, sensor calibration is really important - removing biases
from sensors and estimating their position in some coordinate frame. Yet usually we don't really
think about sensor calibration as something cool or even essential, despite it probably having more
of an influcence on correctness than tuning a neural network might. To put it succintly - if your
data isn't calibrated correctly, you'll get garbage results, no matter what algorithm you throw at it.

This blog is all about sensor calibration - what it is, techniques for calibration, validation, and anything
else. I'll be covering cameras, LIDARs, radars, IMUs, and any other kinds of sensors you could think of. In addition,
I'll cover new and emerging research and patents in sensor calibration that are becoming more mainstream.

A little about me: I'm a software engineer at the Toyota Research Institute working on calibration / localization / mapping.
Previously I worked as a software engineer at Iris Automation building out software tools for vision-based collision
avoidance systems. In addition, I'm working on my Master's degree in Robotics at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor.
