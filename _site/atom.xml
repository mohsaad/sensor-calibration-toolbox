   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In any robotics or industrial application, sensor calibration is really important - removing biases
from sensors and estimating their position in some coordinate frame. Yet usually we don&amp;#39;t really
think about sensor calibration as something cool or even essential, despite it probably having more
of an influcence on correctness than tuning a neural network might. To put it succintly - if your
data isn&amp;#39;t calibrated correctly, you&amp;#39;ll get garbage results, no matter what algorithm you throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is all about sensor calibration - what it is, techniques for calibration, validation, and anything
else. I&amp;#39;ll be covering cameras, LIDARs, radars, IMUs, and any other kinds of sensors you could think of. In addition,
I&amp;#39;ll cover new and emerging research and patents in sensor calibration that are becoming more mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little about me: I&amp;#39;m a software engineer at the Toyota Research Institute working on calibration / localization / mapping.
Previously I worked as a software engineer at Iris Automation building out software tools for vision-based collision
avoidance systems. In addition, I&amp;#39;m working on my Master&amp;#39;s degree in Robotics at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor.&lt;/p&gt;
